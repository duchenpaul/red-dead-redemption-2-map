# [WIP] Red Dead Redemption 2 Map

A dynamic map for Red Dead Redemption 2 that allows a user to place custom 
markers with descriptions.

There are many maps online, but they:
- Require a log in
- Don't remember your settings
- Don't allow for custom user data
- Are sprinkled with ads
- Load slow

Currently everything runs without external requests.
